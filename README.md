Joomla 3.10.999
=============

This repo is a stock Joomla 3.10.12 install as provided officially by Joomla.org, but then with all community supplied hotfixes as and when available (none at preset).

Like it or not, Joomla 3.10.x series is now end of support, but still powers a huge number of websites which have not migrated to later versions of Joomla. This repo will be kept up to date with security fixes and patches for security issues only. No new features or minor bug fixes will be applied.

This follows the success of https://github.com/PhilETaylor/Joomla1.5.999 and https://github.com/PhilETaylor/Joomla2.5.999
